# progPoePart2

Welcome to the recipe program!
To use the program select one of the on screen options

if you select 1 you will enter a new recipe:
Firstly enter the number of ingredients youd like to add
for each ingredient enter: The ingredient name, quantity, unit of measurement,calories and the food group it belongs to.
Then enter the number of steps, for each step enter a brief description of what to do.

If you select 2 you will be able to scale a pre-existing recipe.
Enter the number of the recipe you would like to scale, then choose from the scaling options, you will then be asked if you would
like to keep this scaled value, by entering "y" you will save this new value or by entering "n" the values will not be changed.

If you select 3 it will display all the recipe ingredients, calories, food groups.

If you select 4 you will then reset the ingredient quantities to their original values.

If you select 5 you will be given a chance to erase a recipe and start over, start by entering the number of the recipe you would like to erase 
and then enter a new one.

If you select 0 the program will exit.


What i improved based on lecturer feedback:
I fixed the scaling recipe class as it didnt work previously and i also fixed the resetScaling class as it also did not work in my part 1
I also cleaned up the presentation of the program by starting it off with a menu, instead of jumping straight ahead into creating a recipe.
